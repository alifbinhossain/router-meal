          At the point when Grand Restaurant organizer Tony ventured off the
          shorelines of Oahu following multi day of surfing with his Navy pals
          in the mid 60s, he did what worked out easily for him. He went hunting
          down a delicious burger, a hot container of fries and a virus drink.
          After twenty years, in 1982, it was that feeling of place and
          fulfillment he was attempting to reproduce when he took a little piece
          of the ‘Organization Name’ s and thudded it down right in the
          territory of Southern California.
